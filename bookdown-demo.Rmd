Instructions for how to install the necessary software for this tutorial is available [here](tutorial-installation.md).  Data for the tutorial can be downloaded...

## Dimensionality Issues {-}
Certain algorithms don't scale well when there are millions of features.  For example, decision trees require computing some sort of metric (to determine the splits) on all the feature values (or some fraction of the values as in Random Forest and Stochastic GBM).  Therefore, computation time is linear in the number of features.  Other algorithms, such as GLM, scale much better to high-dimensional (n << p) and wide data with appropriate regularization (e.g. Lasso, Elastic Net, Ridge).

## Sparsity {-}
Algorithms can deal with data sparsity (where many of the feature values are zero) in different ways.  In some algorithms there are ways to speed up the computations if sparsity is present, so it's good to know if these shortcuts are available. 

## Normalization {-}
Some algorithms such as Deep Neural Nets and GLMs require that data be normalized for effective interpretation of the models.  Tree-based algorithms (Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines) do not require normalization.  Tree-based methods only use information about whether a value is greater than or less than a certain value (e.g. x > 7 vs. x &leq; 7), the values themselves do not matter.

## Categorical Data {-}
Algorithms handle categorical data differently.  Some algorithms such as GLM and Deep Neural Nets require that a categorical variable be expanded into a set of indicator variables, prior to training.  With tree-based methods and software that supports it, there are ways to get around this requirement, which allows the algorithm to handle the categorical features directly.  It is important to be cognizant of the cardinality of your categorical features before training, as additional pre-processing (collapsing categories, etc) may be beneficial with high-cardinality features.

## Missing Data {-}
Assuming the features are missing completely at random, there are a number of ways of handling missing data:

1. Discard observations with any missing values.
2. Rely on the learning algorithm to deal with missing values in its training phase.
3. Impute all missing values before training.

For most learning methods, the imputation approach (3) is necessary. The simplest tactic is to impute the missing value with the mean or median of the nonmissing values for that feature.  If the features have at least some moderate degree of dependence, one can do better by estimating a predictive model for each feature given the other features and then imputing each missing value by its prediction from the model. 

Some software packages handle missing data automatically, although many don't, so it's important to be aware if any pre-processing is required by the user.

## Class Imbalance {-}
Algorithms that optimize a metric such as accuracy may fail to perform well on training sets that contain a significant degree of class imbalance.  Certain algorithms, such as GBM, allow the user to optimize a performance metric of choice, which is useful when you have a highly imbalanced training set.

## Overfitting {-}

It is always good to pay attention to the potential of overfitting, but certain algorithms and certain implementations are more prone to this issue.  For example, when using Deep Neural Nets and Gradient Boosting Machines, it's always a good idea to check for overfitting.


## Software {-}
For each algorithm, we will provide examples of open source R packages that implement the algorithm.  All implementations are different, so we will provide information on how each of the implementations differ.

## Scalability {-}
We will address scalability issues inherent to the algorithm and discuss algorithmic or technological solutions to scalability concerns for "big data."

## Introduction

Classification and regression trees (CART) are a non-parametric [decision tree learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning) technique that produces either classification or regression trees, depending on whether the dependent variable is categorical or numeric, respectively.  CART is both a generic term to describe tree algorithms and also a specific name for Breiman's original algorithm for constructing classification and regression trees.

- **Decision Tree:** A tree-shaped graph or model of decisions used to determine a course of action or show a statistical probability.
- **Classification Tree:** A decision tree that performs classification (predicts a categorical response).
- **Regression Tree:** A decision tree that performs regression (predicts a numeric response).
- **Split Point:** A split point occurs at each node of the tree where a decision is made (e.g. x > 7 vs. x &leq; 7).
- **Terminal Node:** A terminal node is a node which has no descendants (child nodes).  Also called a "leaf node."

## Properties of Trees

- Can handle huge datasets.
- Can handle *mixed* predictors implicitly -- numeric and categorical.
- Easily ignore redundant variables.
- Handle missing data elegantly through *surrogate splits*.
- Small trees are easy to interpret.
- Large trees are hard to interpret.
- Prediction performance is often poor (high variance).

## Tree Algorithms

There are a handful of different tree algorithms in addition to Breiman's original CART algorithm.  Namely, [ID3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_algorithm), [C4.5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4.5_algorithm) and [C5.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4.5_algorithm#Improvements_in_C5.0.2FSee5_algorithm), all created by [Ross Quinlan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Quinlan).  C5.0 is an improvement over C4.5, however, the C4.5 algorithm is still quite popular since the multi-threaded version of C5.0 is proprietary (although the single threaded is released as GPL). 

## CART vs C4.5

Here are some of the differences between CART and C4.5:

- Tests in CART are always binary, but C4.5 allows two or more outcomes.
- CART uses the Gini diversity index to rank tests, whereas C4.5 uses information-based criteria.
- CART prunes trees using a cost-complexity model whose parameters are estimated by
cross-validation; C4.5 uses a single-pass algorithm derived from binomial confidence
limits.
- With respect to missing data, CART looks for surrogate tests that approximate the outcomes when the tested attribute has an unknown value, but C4.5 apportions the case probabilistically among the outcomes. 


Decision trees are formed by a collection of rules based on variables in the modeling data set:

1. Rules based on variables' values are selected to get the best split to differentiate observations based on the dependent variable.
2. Once a rule is selected and splits a node into two, the same process is applied to each "child" node (i.e. it is a recursive procedure).
3. Splitting stops when CART detects no further gain can be made, or some pre-set stopping rules are met. (Alternatively, the data are split as much as possible and then the tree is later pruned.)

Each branch of the tree ends in a terminal node. Each observation falls into one and exactly one terminal node, and each terminal node is uniquely defined by a set of rules.

## Splitting Criterion & Best Split

The original CART algorithm uses the Gini Impurity, whereas ID3, C4.5 and C5.0 use Entropy or Information Gain (related to Entropy).

### Gini Impurity

Used by the CART algorithm, [Gini Impurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning#Gini_impurity) is a measure of how often a randomly chosen element from the set would be incorrectly labeled if it was randomly labeled according to the distribution of labels in the subset. Gini impurity can be computed by summing the probability $f_i$ of each item being chosen times the probability $1 − f_i$ of a mistake in categorizing that item. It reaches its minimum (zero) when all cases in the node fall into a single target category.

To compute Gini impurity for a set of m items, suppose $i ∈ {1, 2, ..., m}$, and let $f_i$ be the fraction of items labeled with value $i$ in the set.

$$ I_{G}(f)=\sum _{i=1}^{m}f_{i}(1-f_{i})=\sum _{i=1}^{m}(f_{i}-{f_{i}}^{2})=\sum _{i=1}^{m}f_{i}-\sum _{i=1}^{m}{f_{i}}^{2}=1-\sum _{i=1}^{m}{f_{i}}^{2}=\sum _{i\neq k}f_{i}f_{k}$$

### Entropy

[Entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_algorithm#Entropy), $H(S)$, is a measure of the amount of uncertainty in the (data) set $S$ (i.e. entropy characterizes the (data) set $S$).

$$ H(S)=-\sum _{{x\in X}}p(x)\log _{{2}}p(x) $$

Where,
- $S$ is the current (data) set for which entropy is being calculated (changes every iteration of the ID3 algorithm)
- $X$ is set of classes in $S$
- $p(x)$ is the ratio of the number of elements in class $x$ to the number of elements in set $S$

When $H(S)=0$, the set $S$ is perfectly classified (i.e. all elements in $S$ are of the same class).

In ID3, entropy is calculated for each remaining attribute. The attribute with the smallest entropy is used to split the set $S$ on this iteration. The higher the entropy, the higher the potential to improve the classification here.

### Information gain

Information gain $IG(A)$ is the measure of the difference in entropy from before to after the set $S$ is split on an attribute $A$: in other words, how much uncertainty in $S$ was reduced after splitting set $S$ on attribute $A$.

$$ IG(A,S)=H(S)-\sum _{{t\in T}}p(t)H(t)$$

Where,
- $H(S)$ is the entropy of set $S$
- $T$ is the set of subsets created from splitting set $S$ by attribute $A$ such that $S=\bigcup _{{t\in T}}t$
- $p(t)$ is the ratio of the number of elements in $t$ to the number of elements in set $S$
- $H(t)$ is the entropy of subset $t$

In ID3, information gain can be calculated (instead of entropy) for each remaining attribute. The attribute with the *largest* information gain is used to split the set $S$ on this iteration.

## CART Software in R

Since it's more common in machine learning to use trees in an ensemble, we'll skip the code tutorial for CART in R. For reference, trees can be grown using the [rpart](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpart/index.html) package, among others.

## Introduction

Any tutorial on [Random Forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest)
(RF) should also include a review of decicion trees, as these are models that
are ensembled together to create the Random Forest model -- or put another way,
the "trees that comprise the forest."  Much of the complexity and detail of the
Random Forest algorithm occurs within the individual decision trees and
therefore it's important to understand decision trees to understand the RF
algorithm as a whole.  Therefore, before proceeding, it is recommended that you
read through the accompanying [Classification and Regression Trees Tutorial
](decision-trees.ipynb).


## History

The Random Forest algorithm is preceeded by the [Random Subspace
Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_subspace_method) (aka "attribute
bagging"), which accounts for half of the source of randomness in a Random
Forest.  The Random Subspace Method is an ensemble method that consists of
several classifiers each operating in a subspace of the original feature space.
The outputs of the models are then combined, usually by a simple majority vote.
Tin Kam Ho applied the random subspace method to decision trees in 1995.

[Leo Breiman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Breiman) and [Adele
Culter](http://www.math.usu.edu/~adele/) combined Breiman's
[bagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_aggregating) idea with the
random subspace method to create a "Random Forest", a name which is trademarked
by the duo.  Due to the trademark, the algorithm is sometimes called Random
Decision Forests.

The introduction of random forests proper was first made in a
[paper](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/randomforest2001.pdf) by Leo
Breiman [1]. This paper describes a method of building a forest of uncorrelated
trees using a CART like procedure, combined with randomized node optimization
and bagging. In addition, this paper combines several ingredients, some
previously known and some novel, which form the basis of the modern practice of
random forests, in particular:

- Using [out-of-bag error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-bag_error) as an
estimate of the [generalization
error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization_error).
- Measuring [variable
importance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest#Properties) through
permutation.

The report also offers the first theoretical result for random forests in the
form of a bound on the generalization error which depends on the strength of the
trees in the forest and their correlation.

Although Brieman's implemenation of Random Forests used his CART algorithm to
construct the decision trees, many modern implementations of Random Forest use
entropy-based algorithms for constructing the trees.

## Bagging

Bagging (Bootstrap aggregating) was proposed by Leo Breiman in 1994 to improve
the classification by combining classifications of randomly generated training
sets.  Although it is usually applied to decision tree methods, it can be used
with any type of method. Bagging is a special case of the [model
averaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning) approach.

- Bagging or *bootstrap aggregation* averages a noisy fitted function, refit to
many bootstrap samples to reduce it's variance.
- Bagging can dramatically reduce the variance of unstable procedures (like
trees), leading to improved prediction, however any simple, interpretable, model
structure (like that of a tree) is lost.
- Bagging produces smoother decision boundaries than trees.

The training algorithm for random forests applies the general technique of
bootstrap aggregating, or bagging, to tree learners. Given a training set $X =
x_1, ..., x_n$ with responses $Y = y_1, ..., y_n$, bagging repeatedly ($B$
times) selects a random sample with replacement of the training set and fits
trees to these samples:

For $b = 1, ..., B$:
 1. Sample, with replacement, $n$ training examples from $X$, $Y$; call these
$X_b$, $Y_b$.
 2. Train a decision or regression tree, $f_b$, on $X_b$, $Y_b$.

After training, predictions for unseen samples $x'$ can be made by averaging the
predictions from all the individual regression trees on $x'$:

$$ {\hat {f}}={\frac {1}{B}}\sum _{b=1}^{B}{\hat {f}}_{b}(x')$$

or by taking the majority vote in the case of decision trees.



## Random Forest Algorithm

The above procedure describes the original bagging algorithm for trees. [Random
Forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) differ in only one way
from this general scheme: they use a modified tree learning algorithm that
selects, at each candidate split in the learning process, a random subset of the
features. This process is sometimes called "feature bagging".

- Random Forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their
training set.
- Random Forest is an improvement over bagged trees that "de-correlates" the
trees even further, reducing the variance.
- At each tree split, a random sample of $m$ features is drawn and only those
$m$ features are considered for splitting.
- Typically $m = \sqrt{p}$ or $\log_2p$ where $p$ is the original number of
features.
- For each tree gown on a bootstrap sample, the error rates for observations
left out of the bootstrap sample is monitored.  This is called the ["out-of-
bag"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-bag_error) or OOB error rate.
- Each tree has the same (statistical)
[expectation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value), so increasing the
number of trees does not alter the bias of bagging or the Random Forest
algorithm.

## Decision Boundary

This is an example of a decision boundary in two dimensions of a (binary)
classification Random Forest.  The black circle is the Bayes Optimal decision
boundary and the blue square-ish boundary is learned by the classification tree.

## Random Forest by Randomization (aka "Extra-Trees")

In [Extremely Randomized
Trees](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10994-006-6226-1) (aka Extra-
Trees) [2], randomness goes one step further in the way splits are computed. As
in Random Forests, a random subset of candidate features is used, but instead of
looking for the best split, thresholds (for the split) are drawn at random for
each candidate feature and the best of these randomly-generated thresholds is
picked as the splitting rule. This usually allows to reduce the variance of the
model a bit more, at the expense of a slightly greater increase in bias.

Extremely Randomized Trees is implemented in the
[extraTrees](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/extraTrees/index.html) R
package and also available in the
[h2o](https://0xdata.atlassian.net/browse/PUBDEV-2837) R package as part of the
`h2o.randomForest()` function via the `histogram_type = "Random"` argument.

## Out-of-Bag (OOB) Estimates

In random forests, there is no need for cross-validation or a separate test set
to get an unbiased estimate of the test set error. It is estimated internally,
during the run, as follows:

- Each tree is constructed using a different bootstrap sample from the original
data. About one-third of the cases are left out of the bootstrap sample and not
used in the construction of the kth tree.
- Put each case left out in the construction of the kth tree down the kth tree
to get a classification. In this way, a test set classification is obtained for
each case in about one-third of the trees.
- At the end of the run, take j to be the class that got most of the votes every
time case n was oob. The proportion of times that j is not equal to the true
class of n averaged over all cases is the oob error estimate. This has proven to
be unbiased in many tests.

## Variable Importance

In every tree grown in the forest, put down the OOB cases and count the number
of votes cast for the correct class. Now randomly permute the values of variable
m in the oob cases and put these cases down the tree.  Subtract the number of
votes for the correct class in the variable-$m$-permuted OOB data from the
number of votes for the correct class in the untouched OOB data. The average of
this number over all trees in the forest is the raw importance score for
variable $m$.

If the values of this score from tree to tree are independent, then the standard
error can be computed by a standard computation. The correlations of these
scores between trees have been computed for a number of data sets and proved to
be quite low, therefore we compute standard errors in the classical way, divide
the raw score by its standard error to get a $z$-score, ands assign a
significance level to the $z$-score assuming normality.

If the number of variables is very large, forests can be run once with all the
variables, then run again using only the most important variables from the first
run.

For each case, consider all the trees for which it is oob. Subtract the
percentage of votes for the correct class in the variable-$m$-permuted OOB data
from the percentage of votes for the correct class in the untouched OOB data.
This is the local importance score for variable m for this case.

Variable importance in Extremely Randomized Trees is explained
[here](http://www.slideshare.net/glouppe/understanding-variable-importances-in-
forests-of-randomized-trees).

## Overfitting

Leo Brieman famously claimed that "Random Forests do not overfit."  This is
perhaps not exactly the case, however they are certainly more robust to
overfitting than a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM).  Random Forests can be
overfit by growing trees that are "too deep", for example.  However, it is hard
to overfit a Random Forest by adding more trees to the forest -- typically that
will increase accuracy (at the expense of computation time).

## Missing Data

Missing values do not neccessarily have to be imputed in a Random Forest
implemenation, although some software packages will require it.

## Practical Uses

Here is a short article called, [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Random
Forests](https://medium.com/rants-on-machine-learning/the-unreasonable-
effectiveness-of-random-forests-f33c3ce28883#.r734znc9f), by Ahmed El Deeb,
about the utility of Random Forests.  It summarizes some of the algorithm's pros
and cons nicely.

## caret method "parRF"

Authors: Max Kuhn

Backend: Fortran (wraps the `randomForest` package)

This is a wrapper for the `randomForest` package that parallelizes the tree
building.

```{r   n=30}
library(caret)
library(doParallel)
library(e1071)
```

```{r   n=19}
# Train a "parRF" model using caret
registerDoParallel(cores = 8)

model <- caret::train(x = train[,xcols], 
                      y = train[,ycol], 
                      method = "parRF",
                      preProcess = NULL,
                      weights = NULL,
                      metric = "Accuracy",
                      maximize = TRUE,
                      trControl = trainControl(), 
                      tuneGrid = NULL,
                      tuneLength = 3)
```

## h2o

Authors: [Jan Vitek](http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/jv/), [Arno
Candel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/candel), H2O.ai contributors

Backend: Java

Features:

- Distributed and parallelized computation on either a single node or a multi-
node cluster.
- Automatic early stopping based on convergence of user-specied metrics to user-
specied relative tolerance.
- Data-distributed, which means the entire dataset does not need to fit into
memory on a single node.
- Uses histogram approximations of continuous variables for speedup.
- Uses squared error to determine optimal splits.
- Automatic early stopping based on convergence of user-specied metrics to user-
specied relative tolerance.
- Support  for  exponential  families  (Poisson,  Gamma,  Tweedie)  and  loss
functions in addition to binomial (Bernoulli), Gaussian and multinomial
distributions, such as Quantile regression (including Laplace).
- Grid search for hyperparameter optimization and model selection.
- Apache 2.0 Licensed.
- Model export in plain Java code for deployment in production environments.
- GUI for training & model eval/viz (H2O Flow).

Implementation details are presented in slidedecks by [Michal
Mahalova](http://www.slideshare.net/0xdata/rf-brighttalk) and [Jan
Vitek](http://www.slideshare.net/0xdata/jan-vitek-
distributedrandomforest522013).

```{r   n=38}
#install.packages("h2o")
library(h2o)
#h2o.shutdown(prompt = FALSE)
h2o.init(nthreads = -1)  #Start a local H2O cluster using nthreads = num available cores
```



```{r   n=39}
# Load binary-response dataset
train <- h2o.importFile("./data/higgs_train_10k.csv")
test <- h2o.importFile("./data/higgs_test_5k.csv")

# Dimensions
dim(train)
dim(test)

# Columns
names(train)
```

```{r   n=40}
# Identity the response column
ycol <- "response"

# Identify the predictor columns
xcols <- setdiff(names(train), ycol)

# Convert response to factor (required by randomForest)
train[,ycol] <- as.factor(train[,ycol])
test[,ycol] <- as.factor(test[,ycol])
```

```{r   n=41}
# Train a default RF model with 100 trees

system.time(model <- h2o.randomForest(x = xcols,
                                      y = ycol,
                                      training_frame = train,
                                      seed = 1, #for reproducibility
                                      ntrees = 50)) 
```


## Rborist

Authors: Mark Seligman

Backend: C++

The [Arborist](https://github.com/suiji/Arborist) provides a fast, open-source
implementation of the Random Forest algorithm.  The Arborist achieves its speed
through efficient C++ code and parallel, distributed tree construction.  This
[slidedeck](http://www.rinfinance.com/agenda/2015/talk/MarkSeligman.pdf)
provides detail about the implementation and vision of the project.

Features:
- Began as proprietary implementation, but was open-sourced and rewritten
following dissolution of venture.
- Project called "Aborist" but R package is called "Rborist".  A Python
interface is in development.
- CPU based but a GPU version called Curborist (Cuda Rborist) is in development
(unclear if it will be open source).
- Unlimited factor cardinality.
- Emphasizes multi-core but not multi-node.
- Both Python support and GPU support have been "coming soon" since summer 2015,
not sure the status of the projects.
- GPL-2/3 licensed.


## ranger

Authors: [Marvin N. Wright](http://www.imbs-luebeck.de/imbs/node/323) and
Andreas Ziegler

Backend: C++

[Ranger](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.04409v1.pdf) is a fast
[implementation](https://github.com/imbs-hl/ranger) of random forest (Breiman
2001) or recursive partitioning, particularly suited for high dimensional data.
Classification, regression, probability estimation and survival forests are
supported. Classification and regression forests are implemented as in the
original Random Forest (Breiman 2001), survival forests as in Random Survival
Forests (Ishwaran et al. 2008). For probability estimation forests see Malley et
al. (2012).

Features:

- Multi-threaded.
- Direct support for [GWAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-
wide_association_study) (Genome-wide association study) data.
- Excellent speed and support for high-dimensional or wide data.
- Not as fast for "tall & skinny" data (many rows, few columns).
- GPL-3 licensed.
